Hey there, Thanks for Stopping by!!

I’m **Satyabrata** (in short 'Satya'), and I build things that think, move, and talk back (sometimes even better than humans 😄).
I’m a student pursuing M.Sc. in [Electrical Engineering](https://www.f05.uni-stuttgart.de/ei/) at the [University of Stuttgart, Germany](https://www.uni-stuttgart.de/). I am working at the crossroads of robotics, AI, automation, and software development in [Faculty-5 Computer Science, Electrical Engineering and Information Technology](https://www.f05.uni-stuttgart.de/). Whether it’s making automation, software development or making robots walk, see, or chat — I love giving machines a touch of intelligence and a hint of personality.

I’m someone who genuinely enjoys getting lost in research and discovering new ideas — especially when it involves AI, developemnt and design or anything that blends code with creativity. I love asking questions, building cool things, and exploring domains I know nothing about (yet). Whether it’s training robot dogs to open doors or figuring out how to extract meaning from medical images, I’m always chasing that “a-ha!” moment.

If you're into innovation, tinkering, or just curious about what tech can do next — you're in good company. Let’s explore together

🧠 **_What I'm Up To..._**

Currently, I’m writing my Master Thesis at the [Institute of Automation and Software Systems](https://www.ias.uni-stuttgart.de/) at the University of Stuttgart.

On the _Robotics_ side, its Master Thesis, where I'm Training a RobotDog (yes, the cool quadruped kind!) to navigate indoors and traverse doors — focusing on Human-Robot collaboration. I’m integrating camera perception and speech interfaces using large language models (LLMs), enabling the robot to understand instructions and communicate back through natural speech. It’s a step toward making robots more intuitive and collaborative in shared environments. Think of it as a friendly indoor sidekick that can walk, watch, and chat!

🔧 **_My Research Area Includes..._**

- Deep Learning applications
- Robotics
- Software Development and Automation
- LLMs and GenAI integration with Robotics (exploring...)
- Autonomous Driving
- Automotive Radar

While I may not have mastered everything listed below, these areas deeply interest me and I’m continuously learning and evolving with the field.

🗺️ **_Life Outside the Lab..._**

My journey has taken me across **continents** and **cultures**. I spent an **exchange semester** at [Science Tokyo](https://www.isct.ac.jp/en) (previously Tokyo Institute of Technology) in Japan 🗾, soaking up AI, sushi, fireworks, and witnessing the beauty of Mt. Fuji. This summer, I’ll be heading to the **Ferienakademie** in Sarntal, Italy 🇮🇹 — a highly selective program organized by [Technicla University of Munich](https://www.tum.de/en/?r=1), [FAU Erlangen](https://www.fau.eu/), and [University of Stuttgart](https://www.uni-stuttgart.de/). I have been selected for course-09 which is in collaboration with [Siemens Healthineers](https://www.siemens-healthineers.com/) at the [High Energy Photonic Centre (HEP)](https://www.siemens-healthineers.com/press/features/hep-center), where top students come together to explore big ideas and eat pasta under the Alps.

🧘‍♂️ **_When I'm Not Coding..._**

I’m probably hiking through forests, sketching on a quiet bench, or trying to find the best viewpoint in a new city. I love cultures, languages, and that feeling of being lost (in the good way).

**_If you're building something wild with robots, AI, LLMs, or automation — let’s connect! I’m always up for a great conversation or a crazy collaboration._**
